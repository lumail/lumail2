# About Lumail

Lumail is a console-based modal mail client, primarily maintained and developed
by Steve Kemp.

Further documentation is available in the [README](README.md) file, as well
as on the [project website](https://lumail.org/).

Several other users have contributed bug-reports, code-changes, and useful
suggestions, they are listed at the foot of this document.


# Reporting Bugs

If you wish to report a bug please search [the existing issues](https://github.com/lumail/lumail/issues), to make sure you're not reporting a duplicate.

When reporting a bug please do include the version number, which can be found by
running:

    lumail --version

This will either return the release number if you've downloaded a published
release tarball, or a git revision ID.

If you can test the latest release, that would also be helpful.

The more detail you can contribute the better, but we appreciate that sometimes it can
be hard to know _what_ is causing a crash!


# Contributing Code

If you wish to contribute code to the project then that is wonderful!  More
contributors are always welcomed, and if you report an issue with your intended
change, or questions about the approach to take, it will be responded to promptly.

There is a brief overview of the code structure, layout, and standards in
[the HACKING file](HACKING.md).
